**0x07-pointers_arrays_strings**
This directory contains C programs that focus on pointers, arrays, and strings. 

**Task 0: 0-memset.c** 
Description: The 0-memset.c program defines a function _memset that fills the first n bytes of the memory area pointed to by s with the constant byte b. It returns a pointer to the memory area s. 
Prototype: char *_memset(char *s, char b, unsigned int n);
Standard Library Function: memset

Task 1: 1-memcpy.c 
Description: The 1-memcpy.c program defines a function _memcpy that copies n bytes from the memory area src to the memory area dest. It returns a pointer to dest. 
Prototype: char *_memcpy(char *dest, char *src, unsigned int n);
Standard Library Function: memcpy

Task 2: 2-strchr.c 
Description: The 2-strchr.c program defines a function _strchr that searches for the first occurrence of the character c in the string s. It returns a pointer to the first occurrence of c in s or NULL if the character is not found. 
Prototype: char *_strchr(char *s, char c);
Standard Library Function: strchr

Task 3: 3-strspn.c 
Description: The 3-strspn.c program defines a function _strspn that gets the length of a prefix substring. It returns the number of bytes in the initial segment of s that consist only of bytes from accept. 
Prototype: unsigned int _strspn(char *s, char *accept);
Standard Library Function: strspn

Task 4: 4-strpbrk.c 
Description: The 4-strpbrk.c program defines a function _strpbrk that searches a string for any of a set of bytes. It locates the first occurrence in the string s of any of the bytes in the string accept. It returns a pointer to the byte in s that matches one of the bytes in accept or NULL if no such byte is found. 
Prototype: char *_strpbrk(char *s, char *accept);
Standard Library Function: strpbrk

Task 5: 5-strstr.c 
Description: The 5-strstr.c program defines a function _strstr that finds the first occurrence of the substring needle in the string haystack. The terminating null bytes (\0) are not compared. It returns a pointer to the beginning of the located substring or NULL if the substring is not found. 
Prototype: char *_strstr(char *haystack, char *needle);
Standard Library Function: strstr

Task 6: 7-print_chessboard.c 
Description: The 7-print_chessboard.c program defines a function print_chessboard that prints a chessboard represented as a 2D array of characters. ♟
Prototype: void print_chessboard(char (*a)[8]);

Task 7: 8-print_diagsums.c 
Description: The 8-print_diagsums.c program defines a function print_diagsums that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers. 
Prototype: void print_diagsums(int *a, int size);

Task 8: 100-set_string.c 
Description: The 100-set_string.c program defines a function set_string that sets the value of a pointer to a char. 
Prototype: void set_string(char **s, char *to);
